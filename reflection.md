In this PA I was supposed to get practice with designing and programming functions, using ASCII art, loops, testing code, error checking, and utilizing the many other aspects of Python we've learned so far.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, I followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an plan/algorithm and then developing the code. Key concepts explored were using functions, loops, Booleans, as well as error checking.

My results did match what I expected even though this program was difficult.

The challenges I faced during this assignment was developing functions and loops that were complex. It was nice though to break down parts of the code and functions to simplify it. Its difficult working by myslef, as it is a lot of work to get done by myself. But overall, I enjoyed making this program as it is always fun to make something that you can play. I do believe I learned what I was supposed to and I'm happy with how my code turned out.
